# Presig

**Presig — Know what you sign, before you sign.**

Presig is a developer-friendly toolkit that **decodes Ethereum transactions into plain-English explanations** with **risk insights**.  
Drop it into your dApp, explorer, or dashboard to help users understand what they’re about to sign — *before the wallet popup appears*.
